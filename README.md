===============

Matlab code implementation of algorithm described in UKCI 2002 paper "A multi-objective algorithm based upon particle swarm optimisation, an efficient data structure and turbulence" by Jonathan E. Fieldsend and S. Singh

Implementation does not maintain the seperate data structures mentioned in the original paper, but mimics the structure it imposes on the swarm optimiser (in terms of global best selection), making the behaviours the same. Use the matlab help function to obtain usage details.
